**Why this exsits:**This keyboard was made for fun and for portability. This was an idea I got. It has no firmware, only the pcb file. If it is built pls show or credit at least.

Note to open and edit things like the PCB and case you may need CAD software and or software that can open standard pcb files.

There is not firmware this is up to users prefrence as well as users dessision. 

Have fun buildingh and mess around. It was fun making.
